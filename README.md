# POPA-Social-Network
A social network app created to give the students of AUEB an easier time studying and helping each other. The app has 2 basic functionalities:
1) Online Forum
2) Schedule Manager

As AUEB is a Greek university, both the app contents and the video previews that showcase them require knowledge of the Greek language to be fully understood.
This ReadMe file is to be updated in the future. For the time being, please watch the video previews!

## Online Forum
Uses a NoSQL realtime database provided by Google Firebase. The user can create posts, like posts, comment on posts and view other user profiles.

## Schedule Manager
Uses the Apache POI library to read Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets. The user can import the semester's excel file and the app will give them the option to create a schedule based on the courses they choose to take.
